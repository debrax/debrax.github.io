Congrats, you just landed your first job and discovered you gotta work on some dreaded legacy module.

> I know nothing, why am I here?

Classic [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). Spoiler alert: you're likely wrong, you got there for a reason. Everybody started somewhere, the difference is how quick you get to be productive. Ask for an easy task, dive into the code base. **The sooner you start, the sooner you learn.**

> I'm stuck. Missing something.

We all are at some point. First, check on the internal docs, Google or Stackoverflow. Then ask someone. **Don't stay stuck, be pro-active.** If you're afraid to waste the time of your fellows, consider that the quicker you get the knowledge, the earlier they can rely on you. Be a good guy, update the doc if that was tricky (a README in the source can be enough).

> Business? Whatever.

Hard to swallow, but **business is the key for your productivity**. However skilled you are, you need to understand it to finish the job. Be curious, batch your questions and track what you learn in personal notes or project docs.

> The code is so bad!

**Don't judge, stay humble.** You never know the background. Maybe the project started 20 years ago with one guy who did his best. Maybe the dirty code you see is worth millions. Give it some respect, try to improve it whenever you can.

> I work hard but no one bothers...

External recognition might never come, don't rely on it. Just **expect nothing and work for yourself**. You'll be much less frustrated and still develop worthy skills for your career. If you think your value is not recognized, work on it or move on. There's nothing wrong in quitting if you're stuck.

Hope this can be useful, wish you the best in your programming path!
